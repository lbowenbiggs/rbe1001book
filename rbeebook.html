<h1 id="what-is" class="page-header">What is a Power Transmission?</h1>
<p>A power transmission is a way of manipulating the output of a motor to better suit the needs of the system. 
A correctly-implemented transmission can result in an increase of speed or torque. 
However, no transmission can increase the amount of power being output by the motor. 
For this reason, any increase in speed will result in a decrease in torque and vice versa. 
Alternatively, a transmission could also have no impact on the motor's output torque or speed; it may simply be used to transfer power from where the motor is mounted to where the power is needed.</p>

Remember: Power is Work divided by Time

<h1 id="types" class="page-header">What are the Types of Power Transmissions?</h1>
<p>The two main types of power transmissions used in mobile robots are gears and chains. 
Gears come in many different varieties including spur gears, worm gears, differential gears, and more. 
Each system has individual advantages and disadvantages as far as power input required or output given, space, weight, and functionality. 
Chains are available in many sizes and strengths; this means they are easily adaptable to most designs.</p>

<h2>Gears</h2>
<p>Gears are the most common form of power transmissions. 
The entire system of gears used to manipulate motor speed, torque or direction is called a <code>gear reduction</code>.  For every power transmission using gears, there is, at minimum, a driver gear and a driven gear. A driver gear is the gear that is directly connected to the motor that then “drives” or turns the rest of the system. Driver gears convert torque to force. The driven gear is connected, directly or indirectly, to the driver gear and outputs power to the mechanism. Driven gears convert force to torque. Any gears between a driver gear and a driven gear that have no effect on the total system are called idler gears.
