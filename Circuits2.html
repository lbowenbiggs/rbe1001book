<h2>Circuits and Circuit Elements</h2>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><p>A <span class="vocabColor">circuit</span> is the interconnection of electrical devices in a circular path. To power the circuit, voltage is generated from a power source and moves through the wires and components. <span class="vocabColor">Voltage</span> is the total work per unit charge associated with the motion of charge between two points. The rate at which the electrical charge is flowing through a wire or conductor is called <span class="vocabColor">current</span>. Both current and voltage are required to achieve electrical power. </p></TD>

<TD><p> Some people have trouble conceptualizing electricity because they cannot see it. Try considering the circuit to instead be a system of pipes. Each pipe is essentially a very large wire. The power source, which is essentially a pump, takes in charge with low voltage and outputs charge with high voltage. Similarly, a pump which takes in water of low pressure and pushes out higher pressure water.  The flow rate of the water moving through the pipe would be the voltage. Water flows from areas of high pressure to low pressure; likewise, electricity flows from areas of high voltage to low voltage. The speed at which water moves through a pipe is the current. The size of the pipe acts as resistance. If the pipe is very large, the resistance is very low and the water can flow freely; if the pipe is small, the water flow is much more restricted. Small resistors are basically large pipes, and large resistors are small pipes. </p></TD>

<p><h2>Parallel and Series Resistors</h2></p>

<p>Solving a circuit requires simplifying by combining similar elements. In order to for a circuit with multiple resistors to be solved, the resistors must first be simplified into one total, equivalent resistance. The first step to simplifying resistance is determining whether the resistors are in series or parallel. </p>
	
<p>Two elements are in <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/GitHub/rbe1001book/Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">series</A></span> if they share a node with no other elements connected at the node. Resistors in series add together to get an equivalent resistance. In the figure below, resistors A and B are in series. Two elements are in <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/GitHub/rbe1001book/Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">parallel</A></span> if they form a loop with no other elements in the loop. Resistors in parallel combine by adding the reciprocal sum of each value. In the figure below, resistors C and D are in parallel. </p>

<h2>Explanation of Series and Parallel</h2>
<p>Why do series resistors simply add together while parallel ones are so much more different? The reasoning lies in how the current moves through the circuit. When resistors are in series current is able to flow through all of the resistors in a single loop. So the equivalent resistance of series resistors has to be larger than the largest resistor in the circuit. However when resistors are in parallel the current has to split between the loops created by the parallel resistors. This means that the equivalent resistance will always be smaller than the smallest resistor in the loop. It is important to note that when current flows through a loop of parallel resistors, it splits in a way that is proportional to the resistance of the resistors; higher resistors will have less current flowing through them and vice versa to ensure that there is the same amount of voltage going through the entire circuit. </p>

<p><h2>Kirchoff's Voltage and Current Laws</h2></p>
<p><span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/GitHub/rbe1001book/Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">Kirchoff's Voltage Law(KVL)</A></span> says that the algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop is zero. To solve a circuit with KVL sum all the voltages, paying attention to the polarity of the voltage sources. </p>

<p><span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/GitHub/rbe1001book/Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">Kirchoff's Current Law(KCL)</A></span> says that the algebraic sum of all the currents entering a node is zero. To solve a circuit with KCL, the sum of all the currents leaving a node should be subtracted from all currents entering that same node with any unknown values left as variables.
</p>

<p>In the above drawing, the two nodes in the picture can essentially be considered one node because there are no electrical components between them. In order to adjust this circuit so that all currents are entering the node, make the 2 Amps leaving the node negative. The KCL equation should look like this:
</p>
