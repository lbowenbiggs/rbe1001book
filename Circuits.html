	<p>A <span class="vocabColor"><b>circuit</b></span> is the interconnection of electrical

	moves through the wires and components. <span class="vocabColor"><b>Voltage</b></span> is the total work per unit charge 
	associated with the motion of charge between two points. The rate at which the electrical 
	charge is flowing through a wire or conductor is called <span class="vocabColor"><b>current</b></span>. Both current and voltage are required

	<p> Some people have trouble conceptualizing electricity because they cannot see it. Try 
	considering the circuit to instead be a system of pipes. Each pipe is essentially a very large 
	wire. The power source, which is essentially a pump, takes in charge with low voltage and outputs 
	charge with high voltage. Similarly, a pump which takes in water of low pressure and pushes out 
	higher pressure water.  The flow rate of the water moving through the pipe would be the voltage. 
	Water flows from areas of high pressure to low pressure; likewise, electricity flows from areas of 
	high voltage to low voltage. The speed at which water moves through a pipe is the current. The 
	size of the pipe acts as resistance. If the pipe is very large, the resistance is very low and the 
	water can flow freely; if the pipe is small, the water flow is much more restricted. Small 
	resistors are basically large pipes, and large resistors are small pipes. </p> </div>

	<p>Solving a circuit requires simplifying by combining similar elements. In order to for a circuit 
	with multiple resistors to be solved, the resistors must first be simplified into one total, 
	equivalent resistance. The first step to simplifying resistance is determining whether the 
	resistors are in series or parallel. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Two elements are in <span class="vocabColor"><b>series</b></span> if they share a node with no other 
	elements connected at the node. Resistors in series add together to get an equivalent 
	resistance. In the figure below, resistors A and B are in series. Two elements are in <span 
	class="vocabColor"><b>parallel</b></span> if they form a loop with no other 
	elements in the loop. Resistors in parallel combine by adding the reciprocal sum of each value. 
	In the figure below, resistors C and D are in parallel. </p> </div>

<h2>Explanation of Series and Parallel</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-7">
	<p>Why do series resistors simply add together while parallel ones are so much more different? The 
	reasoning lies in how the current moves through the circuit. When resistors are in series current 
	is able to flow through all of the resistors in a single loop. So the equivalent resistance of 
	series resistors has to be larger than the largest resistor in the circuit. However when resistors 
	are in parallel the current has to split between the loops created by the parallel resistors. This 
	means that the equivalent resistance will always be smaller than the smallest resistor in the 
	loop. It is important to note that when current flows through a loop of parallel resistors, it 
	splits in a way that is proportional to the resistance of the resistors; higher resistors will 
	have less current flowing through them and vice versa to ensure that there is the same amount of 
	voltage going through the entire circuit. </p></div>

<p><h2>Kirchoff's Voltage and Current Laws</h2></p>
<br>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
	<p><span class="vocabColor"><b>Kirchoff's Voltage Law(KVL)</b></span> says that the 
	algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop is zero. To solve a circuit with KVL sum all the 
	voltages, paying attention to the polarity of the voltage sources. </p> </div>

<br><br>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
	<p><span class="vocabColor"><b>Kirchoff's Current Law(KCL)</b></span> says that the 
	algebraic sum of all the currents entering a node is zero. To solve a circuit with KCL, the sum 
	of all the currents leaving a node should be subtracted from all currents entering that same 
	node with any unknown values left as variables.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In the drawing to the right, the two nodes can essentially be considered one node. This is
	because there are no electrical components between them. Remember that changing the sign of the current will change the direction in which it is travelling. </p>	</div>
