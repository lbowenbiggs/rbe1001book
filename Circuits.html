<h2>Circuits and Circuit Elements</h2>
<p>A <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">circuit</A></span> is the interconnection of electrical 
devices in a circular path. To power the circuit, voltage is generated from a power source and 
moves through the wires and components. <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">Voltage</A></span> is the total work per unit charge 
associated with the motion of charge between two points. The rate at which the electrical 
charge is flowing through a wire or conductor is called <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">current</A></span>. Both current and voltage are required 
to achieve electrical power. </p>

<p> Some people have trouble conceptualizing electricity because they cannot see it. Try 
considering the circuit to instead be a system of pipes. Each pipe is essentially a very large 
wire. The power source, which is essentially a pump, takes in charge with low voltage and outputs 
charge with high voltage. Similarly, a pump which takes in water of low pressure and pushes out 
higher pressure water.  The flow rate of the water moving through the pipe would be the voltage. 
Water flows from areas of high pressure to low pressure; likewise, electricity flows from areas of 
high voltage to low voltage. The speed at which water moves through a pipe is the current. The 
size of the pipe acts as resistance. If the pipe is very large, the resistance is very low and the 
water can flow freely; if the pipe is small, the water flow is much more restricted. Small 
resistors are basically large pipes, and large resistors are small pipes. </p>

<p>Resistance and current can be used to determine voltage with <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html"

<p><h2>Parallel and Series Resistors</h2></p>

<p>Solving a circuit requires simplifying by combining similar elements. In order to for a circuit 
with multiple resistors to be solved, the resistors must first be simplified into one total, 
equivalent resistance. The first step to simplifying resistance is determining whether the 
resistors are in series or parallel. </p>
	
<p>Two elements are in <span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">series</A></span> if they share a node with no other 
elements connected at the node. Resistors in series add together to get an equivalent 
resistance. In the figure below, resistors A and B are in series. Two elements are in <span 
class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">parallel</A></span> if they form a loop with no other 
elements in the loop. Resistors in parallel combine by adding the reciprocal sum of each value. 
In the figure below, resistors C and D are in parallel. </p>

<h2>Explanation of Series and Parallel</h2>
<p>Why do series resistors simply add together while parallel ones are so much more different? The 
reasoning lies in how the current moves through the circuit. When resistors are in series current 
is able to flow through all of the resistors in a single loop. So the equivalent resistance of 
series resistors has to be larger than the largest resistor in the circuit. However when resistors 
are in parallel the current has to split between the loops created by the parallel resistors. This 
means that the equivalent resistance will always be smaller than the smallest resistor in the 
loop. It is important to note that when current flows through a loop of parallel resistors, it 
splits in a way that is proportional to the resistance of the resistors; higher resistors will 
have less current flowing through them and vice versa to ensure that there is the same amount of 
voltage going through the entire circuit. </p>

<p><h2>Kirchoff's Voltage and Current Laws</h2></p>
<p><span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">Kirchoff's Voltage Law(KVL)</A></span> says that the 
algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop is zero. To solve a circuit with KVL sum all the 
voltages, paying attention to the polarity of the voltage sources. </p>

<br><br>
<p><span class="vocabColor"><A HREF="Circuit%20Vocab.html" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'Vocab')">Kirchoff's Current Law(KCL)</A></span> says that the 
algebraic sum of all the currents entering a node is zero. To solve a circuit with KCL, the sum 
of all the currents leaving a node should be subtracted from all currents entering that same 
node with any unknown values left as variables.</p>

</TABLE>
<br>
<p>In the drawing above, the two nodes can essentially be considered one node. This is
because there are no electrical components between them. Remember that changing the sign of the current will change the direction in which it is travelling. </p>
